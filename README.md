MazatsKevin_11_22072021 is my take on the eleventh project from OpenClassroom Frontend Dev training. It focuses on React and React Router, and the end goal is to create an home renting web application.


## Setup

1. `yarn`
2. `yarn start`

## Routing

Routes are defined in `src/components/KasaRouter.js`
